# Magical Arena
## Classes
Die: Simulates a die roll with a given number of sides.
Player: Represents a player in the game with attributes such as health, strength, and attack. Players can attack, defend, and take damage.
Arena: Manages the fight between two players.
## How it works
In the prompt, enter the player's attributes such as health, strength, attack.
Firstly, first player will attack and the second player will defend, and in the next turn the second player will attack and the first player will defend.
This process will continue until one player's health reaches zero.
The program will display the winner of the game.
